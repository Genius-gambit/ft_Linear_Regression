# ft_Linear_Regression

## Work Log:

1. Created a new file train.py.
2. getPath() function returns the file path of the file which is used for the program.
3. fetchData() function returns the tuple of two list variables- mileages and prices.
4. gradient_descent_algorithm() function will have the iterative process to find the slope and intercept of the linea regression model.


## Objectives:

1. ~~Get the path of file which will be used for the program.~~
2. ~~Fetch data from the file using csv.~~
3. ~~Apply gradient descent algorithm to create a linear regression model on the given data.~~
4. ~~Plot the observed data and predicted data oon the same figure.~~
5. Create a new file accuracy.py which will generate the accuracy of the model with the observed data.
